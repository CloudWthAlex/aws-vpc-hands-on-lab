\# AWS VPC Hands-On Lab – Network Foundations



\## 📌 Overview



This project documents a \*\*hands-on Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) lab\*\* completed using the \*\*AWS VPC Wizard\*\*. The lab focuses on building and understanding a secure, production-style cloud network with \*\*public and private subnets\*\*, \*\*routing\*\*, and \*\*controlled internet access\*\*.



This repository is designed to demonstrate \*\*practical cloud networking fundamentals\*\* to recruiters, hiring managers, and ATS systems, showing not just theory but real AWS console experience.

\## 🎯 Lab Objectives



By completing this lab, I demonstrated the ability to:



\* Design and create an Amazon VPC using AWS best practices

\* Configure public and private subnets

\* Understand and apply routing concepts

\* Implement secure outbound internet access using a NAT Gateway

\* Explore core VPC security components (Route Tables, NACLs, Security Groups)

\## ⚙️ Technical Steps Completed



\### 1. VPC Creation



\* Created a custom VPC using \*\*AWS VPC Wizard (VPC and more)\*\*

\* CIDR block: \*\*10.0.0.0/16\*\*

\* Deployed in \*\*1 Availability Zone\*\*



\### 2. Subnet Design



\* \*\*Public Subnet\*\*: `10.0.25.0/24`

\* \*\*Private Subnet\*\*: `10.0.50.0/24`

\* Each subnet scoped to a single AZ



\### 3. Internet Connectivity



\* Attached an \*\*Internet Gateway (IGW)\*\* to the VPC

\* Configured routing for public subnet to allow internet access



\### 4. NAT Gateway Configuration



\* Deployed a \*\*Zonal NAT Gateway\*\* in the public subnet

\* Enabled \*\*outbound-only internet access\*\* for private subnet resources



\### 5. Route Tables



\* \*\*Public Route Table\*\*:



&nbsp; \* `10.0.0.0/16 → local`

&nbsp; \* `0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway`



\* \*\*Private Route Table\*\*:



&nbsp; \* `10.0.0.0/16 → local`

&nbsp; \* `0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway`



\### 6. Network Security



\* Reviewed \*\*Network ACLs\*\* (stateless, subnet-level)

\* Explored \*\*Security Groups\*\* (stateful, instance-level)

\* Verified default security group behavior

\## 🔐 Cloud \& Networking Fundamentals Demonstrated



\* VPC isolation and IP addressing (CIDR)

\* Public vs Private subnet design

\* Secure internet access patterns

\* Stateless vs Stateful security controls

\* AWS-managed high availability networking components



---



\## 🌍 Real-World Relevance



This architecture reflects a \*\*common production-ready AWS network design\*\*, where:



\* Web-facing components reside in public subnets

\* Application and database layers remain private

\* Internet access is tightly controlled

\* Security is layered and intentional



These concepts are foundational for roles such as:



\* Cloud Engineer

\* DevOps Engineer

\* Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

\* Junior Solutions Architect

\## 🧠 Key Takeaways



\* A subnet is "public" or "private" based on its \*\*route table\*\*, not its name

\* NAT Gateways enable secure outbound access without exposing private resources

\* AWS networking emphasizes \*\*least privilege and defense-in-depth\*\*

\## 📂 Repository Purpose



This repository is part of my \*\*cloud engineering portfolio\*\*, showcasing hands-on AWS experience and continuous learning through structured labs.



> 📌 \*Note: EC2 deployment was intentionally excluded as per lab constraints.\*
